# The PHP Crude CRUD App

## Demonstrates a basic Dynamic HTML Application using PHP

It doesn't get much more crude than this, but is a great starting point for understanding how **dynamic data-driven web applications** work.

Understand how this one works, and more modern/advanced/complex web development frameworks, won't seem so mysterious.

This application assumes the MySQL database has certain users added and an "employees" database based on a sample dataset from "data charmer"

Look for my Git Repo for Vagrant Automation for the PHP Crude CRUD app that automates the creation of a LAMP server right on your laptop/desktop.

The "credentials.php" file above has the details of the MySQL database connection.

Obviously everything is in the open and unsecure here.  This app assumes that the database is on the same server as the Apache/PHP server.

If it isn't, you'll need to update the credentials file and change "localhost" to whatever the IP address is of your database.

...and obviously change the credentials too...

Section 1:
The purpose of the PHP Crude CRUD Application was for us to understand and work with dynamic data-driven web applications. The application creates a LAMP server right on our local machine, and used MariaDB as our MySQL database that held a bunch of information regarding employees. This allows the user to look up information about an employee, specify what credentials a user may be looking for when searching for employees, as well as add new employees to the database that can be stored and viewed in the MySQL database or displayed as an HTML table.

How to Create a VirtualBox Virtual Machine
If you haven’t already installed the Ubuntu 20.04 Operating System on your machine, skip to section 5 and then come back here to install a virtual machine.


Section 5:
Installing the Ubuntu 20.04 Operating System 
Navigate to Oracle VM VirtualBox and download the
 VirtualBox that is specified for you machine’s
operating system. 

When it the file finishes downloading, run the file. 
It will have an interface that looks something like this:



Once the software is installed, you can add a virtual machine to begin creating local servers.
